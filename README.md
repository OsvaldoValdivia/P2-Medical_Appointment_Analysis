# P2-Medical_Appointment_Analysis

  

This project focuses on understanding the factors influencing patient no-shows for medical appointments. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing 110,527 medical appointments and 14 associated variables, we aim to uncover the reasons behind patients not showing up for their scheduled appointments.

Through this analysis, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with actionable insights into patient behavior and appointment attendance. By understanding the factors contributing to appointment no-shows, medical facilities can implement strategies to mitigate these occurrences and optimize their appointment scheduling processes.
  

This project combines exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and decision tree analysis to comprehensively address the issue of medical appointment no-shows and their underlying causes.
